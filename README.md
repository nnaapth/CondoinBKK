This project is developed to estimate condominium prices by analyzing both environmental and unit-specific factors. 
These include the property's location, the number of units in the development, available facilities, and details of the individual unitâ€”such as its size and room configuration.

The primary goals are to identify which features most significantly influence pricing through feature importance analysis, 
and to build predictive models that estimate prices as accurately as possible. Several machine learning algorithms are explored and compared, including:

- KNeighborsRegressor

- RandomForestRegressor

- LinearRegression

- SVR (Support Vector Regressor)

- DecisionTreeRegressor

- ExtraTreeRegressor

Each model is evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and 
the most promising models are further fine-tuned to enhance performance and deliver the most accurate results.
